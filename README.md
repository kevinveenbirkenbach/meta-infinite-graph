# 🎲 Meta Infinite Graph

An interactive 3D visualization tool to explore the roles and dependencies of the [CyMaIS](https://cymais.cloud) project. Dive into your Ansible roles, see how they connect, and navigate an endless graph of dependencies in real time!

---

## 🚀 Features

- **3D force-directed graph** powered by [3d-force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph)  
- **Lazy loading**: unfolds one role at a time, on demand or automatically  
- **Color-coded nodes** for start, selected, internal, leaf and unloaded roles  
- **Interactive sidebar** with role details, mappings, controls & legend  
- **Bootstrap & Font-Awesome** UI for clean, responsive styling  

---

## 💡 Use Case

Built to visualize the architecture of [CyMaIS](https://cymais.cloud) and to understand how its various Ansible roles relate and depend on one another.

---

## ⚙️ Installation

You can install via **Kevin’s Package Manager**:

```bash
pkgmgr install mig
```

Or simply clone and run with Docker:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevinveenbirkenbach/meta-infinite-graph.git
cd meta-infinite-graph
docker-compose up --build
```

---

## 🚀 Preparing the Data 🗂️

Before launching the Meta Infinite Graph, you need to generate the raw data from your Ansible roles. Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# 🛠️ Generate the full dependency tree of all roles
cymais build tree --s "$(pkgmgr path mig)/roles/"

# 📋 Export a JSON list of all available roles
cymais build roles_list -o "$(pkgmgr path mig)/roles/list.json"
```

* **🔍 `build tree`** scans your roles directory and constructs the complete graph of role dependencies.
* **📝 `build roles_list`** outputs every discovered role into a `list.json`, which the graph viewer’s sidebar uses for role selection.

Once both commands complete successfully, all required data will reside in `$(pkgmgr path mig)/roles/` and can be loaded by the 3D visualization tool. 🚀🎉


## 📝 Usage

1. Browse to `http://localhost:8000`
2. Select your **role** and **mapping(s)**
3. Click “▶️ Start” to auto-expand or click nodes manually
4. Zoom, pan, and inspect details in the sidebar
